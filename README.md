### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Svenja, a marine scientist, and currently finish up my PhD at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/). I work on zooplankton ecology (mainly copepods, amphipods, krill, pteropods and tunicates) and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, with a focus on the subantarctic zone. 

I study different components of the Biological Carbon Pump, for example the impact of zooplankton carcasses on the carbon flux. I also study how different species communities influence the carbon export by using data from a sediment trap archive and I developed a new research tool to measure zooplankton respiration in-situ. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a postdoctoral position for 2022! Message me if you hear anything.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about uni- and multivariate statistics, analysis of time-series data (environmental and biodiversity) and plankton taxonomy.
- ðŸ’» Proficient in R and Latex, currently learning Python.
