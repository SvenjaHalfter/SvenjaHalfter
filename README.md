### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a marine scientist, and currently work as research assistant at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/), after finishing my PhD in early 2022. I'll start a postdoctoral position as a plankton ecologist at [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/) in New Zealand in July 2022. My interests are the impact of climate change on polar ecosystem and carbon cycle as well as ocean data collection and management. 

For my PhD, I studied different components of the Biological Carbon Pump, for example the impact of zooplankton carcasses on the carbon flux, and how different species communities impact carbon export by a sediment trap archive. Also, I developed a new research tool to measure zooplankton respiration in-situ. Check out my [website](https://svenjahalfter.github.io/projects/) for more information on current projects.
