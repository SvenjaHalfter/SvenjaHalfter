### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a marine scientist, and currently work as postdoctoral fellow at the [National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research](https://niwa.co.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand. My research interests are the impact of climate change on polar and temperate ecosystems and carbon cycle as well as ocean data collection and management. I finished my PhD in early 2022, working on the role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump with the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies in Australia.
