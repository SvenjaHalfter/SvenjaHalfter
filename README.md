### Kia ora 👋

I am a zooplankton ecologist and biogeochemist at the [Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://niwa.co.nz/) in Wellington, New Zealand. My research interests are the impact of climate change on polar and temperate pelagic ecosystems and carbon cycle. I finished my PhD in early 2022, working on the role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump with the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies in Australia.
